/*
In this task you will continue working on the linked list of students in
which you would like to store, for each student, their name and age. As
before you are provided with some code that you should not modify:

- A structure definition for the storage of each student's information.
- A main() function to test your code.
- Prototypes for the functions createStudent(), append(), printStudents
  (from previous tasks) and freeStudents() (from the current task).

You will need the function definitions (from previous tasks) for
createStudent(), append(), printStudents() as well as any other
functions you added, such as copyStr() for example. If you were unable
to solve the previous task you have the option to be given the code for
the printStudents() function (see the quiz preceding this task) so that
you can work on the current task.

Your current task is to write a function freeStudents() which takes as
input a pointer that holds the address of the start of a linked list of
students. Your function should then free the space allocated for each
student in this list of students. Your function should not return
anything.

Example

Input:
25 18 32

Output:
Petra is 25 years old.
Remi is 18 years old.
Mike is 32 years old.
